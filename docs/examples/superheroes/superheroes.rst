Project 'superheroes'
*********************

Many data science projects derive fascinating insights from pretty mundane data, like employee records, goods movements
or sales orders. In our first example project, we treat ourselves to some fancy data: we will ingest and
analyze data about superheroes and villains from `Marvel <http://marvel.com/>`_ comics.

In this example, you will learn how to:

    - Define a data model including one-to-many and many-to-many object relationships
    - Implement an ETL pipeline to fill your database, including lots of web scraping
    - Generate statistical analyses and visualizations from the ingested data

.. note:: There are many experts on Marvel comics out there. The author of
          this tutorial is not one of them. The subject serves as an example only. If you feel insulted by
          errors in the comic-related content, please help improving the tutorial by filing an issue
          on GitHub.


The following chapters describe the example in detail:
